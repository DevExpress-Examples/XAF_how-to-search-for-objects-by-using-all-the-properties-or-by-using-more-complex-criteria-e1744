// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to search for objects by using all the properties or by using more complex criteria
// 
// This example provides a possible workaround for the suggestion. The
// Dennis.Search.Win module, shown in the example, provides API to create a
// non-persistent object that can be used to search by properties of a business
// class. Such a non-persistent search-object should implement the ISearchObject
// contract. By default, it's supported by the abstract and generic
// SearchObjectBase class in the module. Search-objects are shown in a Detail View
// with the help of the SearchObjectViewController. To compose a search criteria, a
// specific SearchObjectPropertyEditor is used (it contains the Search and Clear
// buttons). An example use of the implemented module is illustrated in the
// WinSolution.Module.Win module. There is a ProductSearchObject class that is
// inherited from the base SearchObjectBase class. If necessary, you can create
// several search objects for one business class. In UI, all search objects will be
// listed in a drop-down list in the toolbar of a View of your business class.
// Download and run the attached example to see how this works in action. (Take
// special note of the SearchObjectBase class implementation, because it
// asynchronously loads search results of a specific type from the data store into
// the Search Results nested List View.) See Also:
//

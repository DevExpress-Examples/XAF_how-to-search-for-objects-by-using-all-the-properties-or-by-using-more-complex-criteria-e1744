How to search for XAF objects using a complex criterion

To accomplish this task, take the following steps:


1. Create a [non-persistent](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/116516/business-model-design-orm/non-persistent-objects) class with properties that we will use to find persistent objects: [MySearchClass.cs](CS/EFCore/ComplexSearchEF/ComplexSearchEF.Module/BusinessObjects/MySearchClass.cs)
2. In this class add a collection of persistent objects as described at [How to: Show Persistent Objects in a Non-Persistent Object's View](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/116106/business-model-design-orm/non-persistent-objects/how-to-show-persistent-objects-in-a-non-persistent-objects-view#persistent-collection). This collection will show the search results.
3. In this class' non-persistent detail  view, add a custom 'Search' action as described at [How to: Include an Action to a Detail View Layout](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112816/task-based-help/miscellaneous-ui-customizations/how-to-include-an-action-to-a-detail-view-layout)
4. When a user presses this 'Search' action, create a criterion based on ÐµÑ€Ñƒ properties from point 1 and get persistent objects that fit this criterion as described at the 'Get a collection' section of [Create, Read, Update and Delete Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113711/concepts/data-manipulation-and-business-logic/create-read-update-and-delete-data): [MySearchController.cs](CS/EFCore/ComplexSearchEF/ComplexSearchEF.Module/Controllers/MySearchController.cs)
5. To show this non-persistent class view, use the solution from [Ways to Show a View](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112803/ui-construction/views/ways-to-show-a-view/ways-to-show-a-view): [MyShowSearchController.cs](CS/EFCore/ComplexSearchEF/ComplexSearchEF.Module/Controllers/MyShowSearchController.cs)
